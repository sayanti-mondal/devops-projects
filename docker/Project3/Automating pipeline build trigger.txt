To trigger your Jenkins pipeline automatically whenever there is a change in the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

✅ Method 1: Using GitHub Webhooks (Recommended)
GitHub webhooks notify Jenkins immediately when a commit is pushed.

🔹 Steps to Configure GitHub Webhook

In Jenkins:
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Click your Pipeline Job
Click Configure
Under Build Triggers, check ✅ "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"
Save the configuration.

In GitHub:
Go to your GitHub repository → Settings
Click Webhooks → Add webhook
Payload URL: http://YOUR_JENKINS_URL/github-webhook/
Content Type: application/json
Select Just the push event
Click Add Webhook

🔹 Modify Your Jenkinsfile
Make sure your pipeline checks out code from GitHub:

pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        githubPush()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Building project...'
            }
        }
    }
}
Why? 🔥 Fast & Efficient – Jenkins gets notified immediately when a commit is pushed.

✅ Method 2: Using Poll SCM (Less Efficient)
Instead of GitHub webhooks, Jenkins can periodically check for changes.

🔹 Steps
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Click your Pipeline Job
Click Configure
Under Build Triggers, check ✅ "Poll SCM"
In the Schedule field, enter:
Copy
Edit
H/5 * * * *
This checks for changes every 5 minutes
Adjust frequency based on your needs

🔹 Modify Your Jenkinsfile

pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
Why? 🔄 Less efficient – Jenkins keeps polling instead of waiting for GitHub to notify.

Which Method Should You Use?
Method	Efficiency	Speed
✅ GitHub Webhooks (Recommended)	🔥 High	🚀 Instant
✅ SCM Polling	🟡 Medium	⏳ Delayed (polling interval)
🔹 Use GitHub Webhooks for real-time triggering.
🔹 Use Poll SCM if webhooks aren’t an option (e.g., firewall restrictions).
